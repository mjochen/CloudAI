# Upload and presentation

When all the models have been compared it's time for the final upload and presentation. Create an understandable folder structure in your github repo and upload the following files:

* EDA: multiple notebooks, can be attributed to one team member or to the team in general. Contain cleaning and graphs as well the explanation of both.
* Final import: One notebook with a summarized version of all cleaning you found interesting.
* Models: One file per student per dataset. Starts out with the student name. Explain the steps you took to prepare the data.
    * If your computer took a long time building a model, don't remove the output of the code blocks and/or include screenshots of them.
    * If you stored your models in a pickle-file, which is a good idea, remember that github only allows files smaller than 100MB. Remove them if they are bigger before committing.
* Comparison of models: One notebook (per dataset) that gathers the metrics of the models and does a deep down comparison. Also included insights.

Finally your presentation. You'll have 25 minutes per team, but that is including the questions for the oral exam. The structure is as follows:

* Presentation:
    * Who's who in your team (company presentation)
    * EDA: what did you found out? What did you [not] expect?
    * Models: Which was easier to train? Which gave the best result?
    * Conclusion
* Questions
    * (Questions on your models will be asked during the previous presentation.)
    * Each will give a random number. Based in this number you'll get one of the discussion topics as an oral question and you should immediatly answer them. If you're stuck a teammate can help out.
    * If you really don't know the answer you can get another question.

Upload deadline is by the end of the autumn break, presentation is a set time somewhere in the week after.
