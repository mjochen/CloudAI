# **Predicting Titanic Survival with Machine Learning**

Welcome to our Titanic Survival Prediction platform! ðŸš¢

Our cutting-edge machine learning algorithms analyze historical data from the ill-fated RMS Titanic to forecast the likelihood of passengers surviving the tragic voyage. By considering factors such as passenger class, age, gender, and cabin location, our models provide accurate predictions.

Embark on this journey with us as we unravel the mysteries of the Titanic's destiny. ðŸŒŠ
