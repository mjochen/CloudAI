    "# Linear regression\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear regression is a statistical method used to establish a relationship between a dependent variable (also known as the response variable) and one or more independent variables (also known as the predictor variables). It assumes that the relationship between the variables is linear, meaning that the change in the response variable is directly proportional to the change in the predictor variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of linear regression is to fit a line that best explains the relationship between the variables, which can then be used to make predictions about the response variable. The line is estimated by minimizing the sum of the squared differences between the observed values of the response variable and the predicted values from the model.\n",
