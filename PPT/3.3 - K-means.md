# K-means

[The simple explanation.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2e3Ls9H_fc)

Notice anything different from the other two algorithms? We went from supervised to unsupervised. Before we said "we want to know if this is a bad back" or "we want to know how much this book would cost", but now we say "put these books in seperate piles" (not: "put these books in seperate piles based on their topic"), or "group these students".

If you're into the marketing-talk, definitely read [this](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/k-means.html). The sample notebook is really nice too.
