# The AWS-sample notebooks

When you open the AWS-canvas course, there is a link at the bottom to a sandbox environment. Open one!

__Problem! This is the first time we're using AWS, and it's not really obvious if students also have a sandbox. To work around this, open another lab and run the code there.__

__That's how it's documented here as well.__

We'll try to get an example running using XGBoost, linear learner and K-means.
