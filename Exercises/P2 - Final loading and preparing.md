# The project part 

Once you've completed the EDA you'll need to do a final import and prepare the dataset for prediction.

This final input is a summary of all you learned in the EDA-notebooks. It gives a good starting point for the next part, which you'll once again do individually (although, as always, supporting each other). This final import and cleaning should be as **neat and tidy** as you can make it. That means that in one or max two code blocks all columns are renamed (get rid of the spaces in the names), categoricals defined, Na's and outliers removed. At this point it's also what you will be predicting.

When this is done you are ready for step 3.
