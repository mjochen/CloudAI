# Second chance exam

The presentation for this exam will take place in August, the exact date will be distributed by the end of June. The deadline of uploading will be a couple of days before the presentation.

## Individual project

You have to choose 2 datasets from kaggle. One regular and one time related. Include the link to the dataset and the kaggle notebooks you used as inspiration for your project. (If we can find notebooks that you have not mentioned that include code that you literally used this will be considered fraud.)

Perform:
* Data cleaning on both datasets (missing values, null-values, ...)
* Data exploration on both datasets (distribution of data, graphs, correlation heatmap, ...)
* A 'manual' prediction for both datasets
    * Implement a model of your choosing (include the reason you chose this model) and predict values. Also include the parameters of your model.
* A Pycaret-prediction of on of the datasets
* A prediction on AWS on the other dataset

## Presentation

Present your findings during a presentation in August. Do remember that during this presentation you will be given additional oral questions drawn randomly from the discussion topics.

Good luck!
