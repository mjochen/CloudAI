# Discussion topics part 4

## The AWS-lesson

1. What is the difference between univariate and multivariate data?
1. What is the difference between cyclical and seasonal data?
1. Time series data tends to be correlated. What does this mean?
1. What data augmentation would have been useful in the bike-highway data? (The exercise on grouping data, 2.4)
1. What meta data would have been useful in the bike-highway data? (The exercise on grouping data, 2.4)
1. There are four ways of filling in missing data in time-series data (Forward fill, backward fill, moving average an interpolation). Explain them with an example.
1. What is the lookahead risk when using backward fill?
1. What is the big problem with an out of stock-problem?
1. What is downsampling? And when is it a good idea?
1. What is smoothing in the context of outliers in time series data? Why are we handling outliers differently in time series data?
1. Explain seasonality in time series with an example.
1. When selecting a predictor in AWS forecaster you need to select a domain. Explain and give some examples.
1. When predicting your data can include the time series, metadata and related. Explain with an example. Which are required and which are optional?
1. Explain what a backtest windows is, and how it relates to the test and training-set split.
1. What are prediction quantiles?
1. When would you use the P10 quantile? And the P50? And P90?

## The powerpoint and exercises

1. Why is a moving average a bad filler for the measurement of meters?
1. When would a moving average be a good filler?
1. Explain stability (or stationarity) in a time series dataset.
1. Explain autocorrelation in a time series dataset.
1. Explain Arima, ETS, DeepAR+, NPTS and Prophet. (These are actually five different questions.)
