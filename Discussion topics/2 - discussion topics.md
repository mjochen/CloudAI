# Discussion topics part 2

## The powerpoint and exercises

1. The powerpoint states: "The model should generalize to unseen data if you are using it to predict. If it’s just to explain the data overfitting isn’t a problem." Explain!
1. To get rid of outliers, we simply look at the values and delete the row with the highest value for every column. Or is there a better way?
1. What are the key differences between classification and regression in supervised learning? Can you provide examples of each?
1. Why is accuracy used to evaluate classification models, while sum of squared error (r²) is used for regression models? Are there other metrics that could be used?
1. How does the approach differ when dealing with binary classification compared to multi-class classification?
1. Why is it said that unsupervised learning does not require a data scientist to prepare the data? What kind of preparation is still necessary?
1. How does the concept of multidimensional space help in understanding the results of unsupervised learning algorithms?
1. Why is feature engineering crucial in predictive modeling? Can you give an example of a feature that significantly improved a model's performance?
1. What are the differences between linear and polynomial regression? When might you choose one over the other?
1. Why is RMSE a preferred metric for evaluating regression models? What are its advantages and disadvantages compared to other metrics?
1. What can residuals tell us about the performance of a model? How can you use residuals to improve your model?
1. When looking at the diamond pricing notebook: what were we trying to achieve in the notebook? Dit the resulting numbers explain something we couldn't see before? Were the numbers still meaningful?

## The AWS-lesson

1. Is it a good idea to be using Python and Jupyter notebooks? Are there any alternatives like Julia, R, Java, C#, …?
2. Amazon has some managed services that provide AI-services without the need for any real understanding of the technology involved. Will they preform better than a model that we can make ourselves? What are the [dis]advantages of using them?

3. Give an example of supervised and unsupervised learning when using a file with all data about students (grades, but also age, shoe size, family situation, …).
4. We have a file of student grades and how much they studied for a test. We want to predict their test scores. Explain the difference between binary classification, multi-label classification and regression in this context.
5. Can we use AI to do feature engineering? Is it regularly done this way?
6. Explain over- and underfitting in the context of multi-label classification.
