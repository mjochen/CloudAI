# Discussion topics chapter 5 - Data augmentation

1. Why is it important to clean and prepare data before applying machine learning techniques?
1. What challenges might arise when scraping data from external sources, and how can they affect the reliability of your dataset?
1. What are the risks of ignoring missing values or improperly handling them during data cleaning?
1. Why is it crucial to use proper datetime datatypes instead of splitting dates into separate fields?
1. Why is exploring data important? Think patterns, correlations, and potential issues...
1. Why is domain expertise important during the data exploration phase?
1. How do different modeling techniques (e.g., regression, clustering) depend on the quality and structure of your data?
1. How do you determine whether your data is "tidy," and why does this matter for analysis?
1. What problems can arise when variables, observations, or values are not properly separated in a dataset?
1. How can outliers distort statistical analysis, and what methods can be used to detect and handle them?
1. What is the difference between IQR and standard deviation when identifying outliers?
1. When should you remove outliers versus transform or model them separately?
1. How does data skewing affect averages and medians?
1. What are examples of positively and negatively skewed data distributions?
1. Why is it important to distinguish between categorical, ordinal, and nominal data types?
1. Why do we one-hot encode?
1. What are the pros and cons of imputing missing values using mean, median, or mode?
1. What can advanced imputation techniques (e.g., regression, KNN) introduce into your model?
1. What types of bias can affect data and models, and how can they be mitigated?
1. Why is it critical to keep the test set isolated during model development?
1. How does scaling affect different machine learning algorithms?
1. What role does feature engineering play in improving model performance and generalization?
1. How can derived features carry more predictive value than raw inputs?
